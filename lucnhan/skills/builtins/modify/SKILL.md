Task: Modify the binary's behavior based on the user's natural language description. You will autonomously explore the binary to understand it, formulate a concrete plan, and apply minimal patches.

## Phase 1: Exploration Strategy

Your goal is to build enough understanding of the binary to know WHERE and HOW to make the requested change. Use `exploration_report` to log every significant finding.

### Step 1: Orientation (1-2 turns)
- `get_binary_info` — architecture, format, size
- `list_imports` + `list_exports` — what APIs does the binary use?
- `search_strings` / `list_strings_filter` with keywords from the user's request
  - For a game mod request mentioning "snake", search for: "snake", "score", "point", "length", "size", "spawn", "init", "level", "life", "speed"
  - Cast a wide net with goal-relevant keywords

### Step 2: Targeted Search (2-5 turns)
- From string hits, use `xrefs_to` to find which functions reference them
- From import hits, use `xrefs_to` to find call sites
- `search_functions` for names containing relevant keywords
- Build a shortlist of candidate functions
- **Log each candidate** with `exploration_report(category="function_purpose")`

### Step 3: Deep Dive (3-10 turns)
- `decompile_function` on the most promising candidates
- Trace data flow: where does the target value come from? Where is it used?
- Identify exact instructions and constants that control the behavior
- Use `get_il` for detailed intermediate representation when needed
- **Form concrete hypotheses** and log with `exploration_report(category="hypothesis")`
  - Example: "Changing the constant 3 at 0x401248 to 6 would double the snake's initial length"
  - Example: "Multiplying the score increment at 0x4015C2 by 2 would double points"

### Step 4: Transition Decision
- When you have identified ALL locations that need to change, call `phase_transition(to_phase="plan")`
- If you're stuck or the binary is too complex, use `ask_user` to get hints
- Don't transition too early — make sure you understand the full picture

## Phase 2: Planning Guidelines

When you transition to the PLAN phase, you will receive a synthesis prompt with your accumulated findings. Create a numbered plan where each step specifies:

1. **Exact address** to modify (hex)
2. **Current behavior** at that address (what the code does now)
3. **Desired behavior** (what it should do after the patch)
4. **Patch strategy** (which bytes/instructions to change, new values)

Be precise. The plan will be shown to the user for approval before execution.

Example format:
```
1. Change snake initial length constant at 0x401248 from 3 to 6 (mov eax, 3 -> mov eax, 6)
2. Double score increment at 0x4015C2: change `add [score], 10` to `add [score], 20`
```

## Phase 3: Execution

Activate `smart-patch-ida` via `activate_skill` and follow its workflow for each planned change.

After each patch, you MUST call:
```
exploration_report(category="patch_result", address=..., summary="...", original_hex="...", new_hex="...")
```

This is required for the Phase 4 save gate to know what was applied.

### Safety Rules
- Never exceed original instruction boundaries
- NOP-pad if new instructions are shorter
- Always backup before patching
- Always verify after patching
- Revert on failure (write back original bytes)
- Minimal changes only — patch the fewest bytes possible
